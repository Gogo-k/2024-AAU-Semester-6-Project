How to use Echoboard (extension on Openboard)

1. Either download the .apk file (or download the repo, and via Android Studio create an .apk and transfer it on your android device)
2. Allow installation of 3rd party applications on your android device, via settings.
3. Install the .apk and follow the instructions to enable the keyboard (if this doesn't work manually change your keyboard via settings).
4. Grant additional accessibility settings to the keyboard, via app settings for openboard.
5. Now you can write, and see real-life feedback in the orange bar.
